"""
Every committed result file holds its evidence lists in the documented order.

`test_environment/headroom_results/` is committed as worked examples for a
person to read, the same way `test_environment/scps/` and `rcps/` are
committed Terraform. Nothing compared its ordering to the rule that produces
it, so two of the thirty-two drifted out of it unnoticed: a cluster's member
instance was captured ahead of the cluster it belongs to, once in one
account's `violations` and once in another's `compliant_instances`.
Reordering the two entries fixed the drift; this file is what stops it
recurring. A third file had drifted in a way the first version of this sweep
could not see: the S3 shared-account example held three account-keyed maps in
the order the buckets named the accounts, not key order. The sweep now walks
every record's map-valued and record-list-valued fields as well.

`entry_sort_key` is imported rather than restated, because what this file
checks is that the committed *data* agrees with the rule, not that the rule
itself is correct - `tests/test_checks_base.py` already pins the rule against
literals it does not derive from the code.
